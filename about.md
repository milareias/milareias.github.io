# About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Camila Areias, and Iâ€™m from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·, specifically from a small town nestled in the mountains of Rio de Janeiro. Iâ€™m passionate about staying active, whether itâ€™s running, working out, or exploring new restaurants with my partner.

My journey has been an exciting one. From a young age, Iâ€™ve been involved in sports, which gave me the opportunity to travel extensively ðŸŒŽ. This sparked my love for exploring the world. Through my career in science, Iâ€™ve had the chance to live and work in Geneva, Zurich, California, and Amsterdam. Iâ€™ve also attended conferences in incredible cities like Rome, Dubrovnik, Paris, San Francisco, and Barcelona ðŸš€.
